# Project Summary: Device Management System

## Overview
This is a Laravel-based web application for managing device assignments, user permissions, and device groups. The system appears to be designed for managing access to remote devices (likely mobile devices or emulators) through a gate system, with role-based access control and device assignment management.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Laravel 12 (PHP 8.2+)
- **Frontend**: Blade templates with Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js
- **Database**: MySQL (primary) + SQLite (local development)
- **Build Tools**: Vite, PostCSS
- **Testing**: PHPUnit

- Log rotation and monitoring

## Usage Notes for LLM Agents

### Key Entry Points
1. **Device Management**: `DeviceController` handles all device-related operations
2. **User Management**: `UserAssignmentController` manages user assignments
3. **Authentication**: Laravel Breeze provides authentication system
4. **Database**: Dual database setup with external device data source

### Common Operations
- Device assignment: Use `DeviceAssignment` model
- User permissions: Check `User` model role methods
- Device data: Access through `DeviceService` or direct `mysql_second` connection
- Group management: Use `DeviceGroup` model and related controllers

### Configuration
- Database connections in `config/database.php`
- Application settings in `config/app.php`
- Frontend build in `vite.config.js` and `tailwind.config.js`

This system is designed for managing remote device access with sophisticated role-based permissions and device grouping capabilities.
